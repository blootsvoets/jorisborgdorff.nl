<h2>Understanding</h2>

<p>What tools do we need to understand the world and improve it?</p>

<p>How do we plan for emergencies like a fire and respond to them? What are
    effective medical interventions? What can we learn from a large text
    corpus?</p>

<p>These are broad questions that I design data models
    and computer simulations for. Then I write software to compute and visualize
    a simplified answer.</p>

<p>I use Javascript, Python, and Scala a lot. In the years, I also coded
    Java, R, C, C++, PHP, Perl, bash, Haskell, MATLAB and Mathematica.
    I started coding at home
    with a Linux server compiled from scratch. Since,
    I frequently use clusters, supercomputers, cloud and now Docker and
    Apache Spark. Results are visualized with interactive websites and flexible
    Jupyter Notebooks.</p>

    profile</a> for a full CV. My PhD thesis,
    <a href="http://dare.uva.nl/record/480406">Distributed Multiscale Computing</a>, is
    about distributing the computations of component-based simulation code. During my PhD
    research, I was head developer of the multi-lingual distributed simulation engine
    <a href="http://apps.man.poznan.pl/trac/muscle">MUSCLE 2</a>. Other software I
    co-authored can be found on <a href="https://github.com/blootsvoets">my GitHub
